# Mooseache — How web browsers would be if they'd just been invented

This is an example web browser built with Python and Qt. Using the 
QtWebEngineWidgets system introduced in Qt5.6, this provides a single-window
browsing experience with the usual controls, as well as saving and loading HTML.

PyQt in general, [take a look at my ebook & online course
"Create Simple GUI Applications"](https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications)
which covers everything you need to know to start building your own applications with PyQt.
